# ML-Housing-Price-Deployment

## Overview
This project aims to predict house prices using machine learning techniques. The project is organized into two main scripts: a data preprocessing script (`datapreprocessing.ipynb`) and a training script (`modeltraining.ipynb`). The data preparation script includes functions for cleaning, encoding, and splitting the dataset, while the training script involves model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation. A link to the bonus assignment of a deployment and monitoring plan has been attached.

## Project Structure
This is the directory structure of the project:
- `datapreprocessing.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for data preprocessing.
- `modeltraining.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for model training.
- `requirements.txt`: File containing necessary dependencies.
- `BonusDeploymentPlan.pdf`: PDF document for the bonus deployment and monitoring plan.

## How to Run
1. Run the data preparation script (`datapreprocessing.ipynb`) to clean and preprocess the dataset.
2. Run the training script (`modeltraining.ipynb`) to train models, perform hyperparameter tuning, and evaluate on the test set.
3. Ensure that all necessary dependencies from `requirements.txt` are installed, and the dataset is in the correct format before running the scripts.
